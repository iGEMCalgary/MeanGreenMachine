Solidworks parts and drawing to build a standardized grading system for canola seeds using usb cameras.


As the canola industry has poorly implemented standards for seed grading, there was a need to create a machine to standardize the conditions in which seeds are graded. Governmental agencies have everything standardized in their grading facilities but grain elevators do not have that luxury.
This project seeks to address this problem, in conjunction with GreatGrader to help the canola industry understand its seeds.
